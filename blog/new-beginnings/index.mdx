Hello! Welcome to [cjl.ee](https://cjl.ee)! It feels pretty weird typing this
in to VSCode, but here we are!

<br />

As a quick introduction, my name is CJ Lee, and I'm a college student studying Computer
Science. It's currently my winter break after the first semester of my sophomore
year, and I've always really wanted to set up my own website, so I went for it!

<br />

The website itself is created in React with Gatsby. I've designed nearly everything
from the ground up, although I admittedly need to go back and clean a lot of things up. 😅

<br />

But for now, I really wanted to add a blog to my site, so this is my first post!
Although I was a bit more judicious in my design choices for the main page, this blog
has been kinda scrappily put together. I'm not really digging how it looks right now,
so I'll probably have another go at it soon. Also, apparently [EB Garamond used to be a
not-so-good choice as a web font](https://designforhackers.com/blog/garamond/), and I'm
also not sure if it looks great on longer-form texts like this blog post, so I might change
that out too as well.

<br />

Basically, there's a lot of changes I still need to make. I doubt any people will
see this post in the month of January, but if you happen to, then it's more likely
than not that this page will look different the next time you come by!

<br />

Nonetheless, this is just a preliminary post to see how things render on the browser.
I'll make a more 'bloggy' post later on when I'm happier with how the site looks.
Until then, stay romantic! :)

The remainder of this blog is testing out something of the functionalities with MDX:

**Testing bold face!** Not bold face...

# A Big Header 1

## Smaller Header 2

<ul>
  <li> List Items? </li>
  <li> Whoa </li>
</ul>

Text afterwards
