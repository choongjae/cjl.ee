This week, I only acquired two new songs for my repertoire. Normally,
most of my liked songs come from Spotify's _Discover Weekly_ playlist, which
tends to do a pretty good job - as my friend puts it, it's the best feeling
when it hits upon an _optimal local minima_ with respect to my musical preferences.

Anyways, without further ado, let's get into the two songs from this week.

<SongFeature songName="Sleeping Through the End of the World" songArtist="PuffHost" songYear="2020" songLink="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2iNJfGfdgz0" />

One of the first draws of this song is the ostinato (repeated musical phrase, from Google)
that's sprinkled throughout the melody. I'm a big sucker for just _interesting_-sounding
tunes and beats, and that ostinato scratches that itch for me.

Of course, my music taste generally lies in chill, vibey music, which I think
this song starts off with. However, I really like how it maintains a strong
sense of tension; the melody sounds consistently stressed, and though there is a slight
reprieve after each phrase, I feel like this tension keeps growing stronger until
it releases at 1:52. At that point, the song really shines; the ostinato comes back
with an energizing chorus that helps relieve all of the tension.

And then, just as soon as it started, the instrumental cuts off and the song quietly
ceases with a nice finishing lyric. Last week, I had another song on my _Liked_ that
I removed because it had a really weird ending: _[Right Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAAzM-czJDU)_
by Sean McVerry. I'm not a musical expert by any means, but it's
disappointing to have a solid song ruined by what seems to be a nonsensical outro.

Also, if you can't tell, I really like the term _ostinato_ now. Ostinato ostinato ostinato.

I don't think this song really falls under that "chill vibe" category I mentioned earlier.
It's definitely more upbeat, and I like the backing melody. It's a lot of fun to listen to.

For me, I don't focus on the lyrics of songs. For some reason, I'm not that good
at processing words of songs while I listen to them - I really have to focus to understand
what the singers are saying, unless the lyrics really stand out. That being said,
I have absolutely no idea what the lyrics of this song are after having
listened to it for a dozen times. Not sure if that's common or not, but take that for what you will.

Nonetheless, my favorite part of the song comes from the sudden slow-down at 2:50. The melodic
profile completely changes, and it's a very nice contrast from the rest of the music.
However, the pace starts picking up again and it segues back into the main melody soon afterwards.
I think they did a nice job with handling this ramp-up, and it makes sense musically.
I do wonder how it would have sounded if they did something more with the lull;
it had a lot of _cool_-sounding potential, and unlocking that potential may have elevated
this song into being a personal favorite.

Either way, it's a great listen that covers a lot of bases quite well. Good vibes all around!

(Also, this is a bit irrelevant, but the music video reminds me a bit of the music videos
from _[Still Woozy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL3wWykAKfs)_. Maybe that's just me.)
