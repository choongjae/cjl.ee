I've got two new songs for this post. Like I said last time, I normally get my songs
from Spotify's _Discover Weekly_, but one piece from this week's collection came
from some random shuffle. That is to say, my _Discover Weekly_ this week was actually a bit
lackluster (we are exiting the local minima ðŸ˜”), but let's dive into it!

<SongFeature songName="Dead Man Walking" songArtist="Grant & Ellis" songYear="2022" songLink="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKCi_85Hg9M" />

This electronic piece reminds me a lot of the music you'd hear from places like
_League of Legends_ or _Valorant_. That is to say, it's intensely energetic and
hype-ful. I randomly stumbled across this song from shuffle, and it was just too
exciting not to like.

To be honest, there's not much to comment on the song itself. It's a pretty standard
electronic bop, but they do a really good job of blending the lyrics with the progression
of the music. The 'drops' happens at 0:58 and 1:50, and no doubt that they're GREAT.
I really like how the second drop eases in with a **_p crescendo_** to give it more impact.
I'd love to hear this song in a bigger setting, and it's definitely worthy of any workout playlist.

By the way, _[Die For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7MYJghRWt0)_ is a _Valorant_ song
that I think is pretty similar to this one. Though, listening to them two makes me realize
how much comparatively more energetic _Dead Man Walking_ is.

Compared to the previous song, I think this one is a bit more idiomatic of my
overall music preferences. It's a bit more experimental, and though it's not
super chill, it's just _fun_ to listen to.

Guess what word I'm about to use? Ostinato. That's right, this song has another
ostinato (at least, I hope I'm using it right lol) that shows up a lot in the
beginning and slightly changes shape throughout the song, but helps give
the music a defining character. There's two big drops in the song; the first is at
0:25, and the second, bigger one is at 1:48. Similarly to _Dead Man Walking_, one thing I think
the second climax in song does well is that it eases into the all-out with a _submerged_, muted sound before
going full force at 1:52, which hypes it up even more. Overall, both climaxes are chaotic, loud, and
buzzy - but they flow and harmonize well and are just really exuberant. Fun!

The only iffy part of the song for me is the ending "augh" sound. Very minor detail,
but it brings me back to what I mentioned last week - I feel like these extra, unrelated
bits added to the end of any song always make the song worse. I'm a little split here,
because it's _really_ minor, but I don't know. It doesn't necessarily sound bad... but
I feel like it doesn't really add anything. I'm very curious at what the reasoning
was to add such a bit.
